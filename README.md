Last Project DAW
I wanted to start using github on an easy and direct way so I chosed SourceTree as I knew it would be better for me than just
remembering all of those commands you need to use github in -at least- a practical way. So then I can just focus on my project
and at the same time I know I will have this to backup my progress and see where I have made mistakes so I can correct them
easily and without problems. 
Anyway, I think I could start using github with this, but I don't really know if I will stick to SourceTree... Only time
will tell either way.
Even tho I need to thank the github project and all the people who have been working on it. Thank you all, with this kind of 
commitment I feel even more commited to my project.
See you around!
